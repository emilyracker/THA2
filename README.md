# Data Set 1: DHS Data
The [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/Data/) are household level surveys compiled by USAID. 
This is some of the highest quality disaggregated international data available. 

To get this data: 

1. [Register a project](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm). 
2. Wait for approval
3. Request data from Colombia DHS V-II 2015
4. Download COBR72DT.ZIP *(I attached this as a zip file to Canvas)*
5. Unzip COBR72DT.ZIP 
6. Use COBR72FL.DTA

**How to read the data**
I have also uploaded a .do file that can be used as the codebook. 
Unless I find a less tedious way to do this in python, I think it would be easier to run the COBR72DT.do file first in stata and then upload a new .csv file to python. For now, I'm leaving the columns untitled but they can be cross-referenced with the .do file.  


# Data Set 2 & 3: USAID Data
